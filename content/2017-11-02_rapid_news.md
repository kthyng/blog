Summary: NSF RAPID award and associated news


I was award an NSF RAPID grant to study the impacts of Hurricane Harvey on the Galveston Bay area. Harvey released a massive amount of freshwater into the region, which flooded Galveston Bay and created extremely fresh conditions. With my co-PI Scott Socolofsky in Civil Engineering, I am measuring the velocities and density structure both within and outside of Galveston Bay to understand the impact and subsequent return to normal conditions in the region.

We've had some media about the project, along with other RAPIDs in the department:

The first major hurricane to make landfall on the United States mainland since 2005, Hurricane Harvey was a disaster: killing tens, displacing millions and causing billions of dollars in property damage.</p></blockquote>

After one of our cruises:

Now, researchers from Texas A&M University are working to collect vital information on how the storm impacted the waterways of coastal Texas.</p></blockquote>
