Dr. Piers Chapman oversaw the release of more [driftcards](http://gisr.tamu.edu/driftcard/) in Galveston Bay a few months ago. A reporter from Houston found one and did a story! She talked with both Piers and me, though only my hand ultimately made it into the [quick clip](http://abc13.com/science/find-yellow-card-on-a-beach-youre-helping-science/1066827/).
