Summary: A supplement The Oceanography Society magazine, on Women in Oceanography, is available.


A [supplement](http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOceanographySocie/f56777f7d3/b19a242f4a/2ed8deb6f0) to the Oceanography Society magazine documenting some of the women in oceanography, has just been released. This supplement contains articles about women who also wrote ten years ago, in the original supplement, as well as women who have entered the field since then [(like me)](http://www.tos.org/oceanography/archive/27-4_supp_bios.pdf#page=191).
