Summary: An update on the 2014 harmful algal bloom prediction


Last fall I made a [prediction](http://kristenthyng.com/blog/2014/10/08/hab-prediction/) that there would not be a major harmful algal bloom in Texas caused by the phytoplankton <i>Karenia brevis</i>. I would like to follow that up by saying that we were right!

Texas Parks and Wildlife issues [updates](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/status.phtml) about the state of harmful algal blooms. The website shows that while there were some low levels of cell abundance found in August and September, there was never a major bloom.
