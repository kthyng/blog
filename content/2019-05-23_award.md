Summary: Aggies Celebrate Teaching! Award


I was honored to receive a teaching award this spring! I received the [*Aggies Celebrate Teaching!*](https://cte.tamu.edu/Events-and-Awards) award, which is given out by the Texas A&M Center for Teaching Excellence. 100 teachers were nominated across three campuses, and 6 winners were selected. Students nominate teachers who have made a big impact on them through their transformative teaching. There was a reception associated with this award that was lovely to attend and hear from the students about their experiences.

There are more details in an article from the [College of Geosciences](https://geonews.tamu.edu/news/2019/04/ocng_thyng-ACTaward.php) and the [Center for Teaching Excellence](http://cte.tamu.edu/News/3rd-Annual-Aggies-Celebrate-Teaching!-Recognized-S).
