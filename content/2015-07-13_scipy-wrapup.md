Summary: The SciPy 2015 conference


The SciPy conference was great this year, as always. It started with two days of [tutorials](http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/289057/?&), which I co-organized with Justin Vincent. Those seemed to go well and I enjoyed the ones that I sat in on. [Materials](http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/304620/?&) for many of the courses are available, as well as [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gcpabmu61kKcToLz0FapmHu) of the entire class.

<br><br>

The [conference itself](http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/297898/?&) was three days of talks with a poster session one day. I got to give two talks on Friday of the conference:

<br><br>

The colormaps talk followed up on an [excellent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU&list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gcpabmu61kKcToLz0FapmHu&index=2) by [Nathaniel Smith](https://github.com/njsmith) which explained the background of some color theory and proposed a new default colormap for matplotlib. He and [Stefan van der Walt](https://github.com/stefanv) put together a helpful tool, [viscm](https://github.com/BIDS/viscm), for making colormaps that enforcing linear perceptual changes in space through the colormap.

<br><br>

There was excitement in the community about colormaps that was fun to participate in. My proposed set of colormaps, previously called cmtamu, is now renamed [cmocean](https://github.com/matplotlib/cmocean) and is sitting under the umbrella of matplotlib. I'll be contributing to matplotlib in this area and hopefully more over time.

I was also honored to be included in a [write up](http://www.agilegeoscience.com/blog/2015/7/10/software-stats-and-tidal-energy) about the conference by [Matt Hall](https://about.me/kwinkunks), particularly for my talk on tidal energy.
