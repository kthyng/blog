Summary: New drifter animations on the Texas-Louisiana shelf


There are [new animations](http://kristenthyng.com/txla_drifters.html) I put together of surface drifters starting uniformly throughout the Texas-Louisiana shelf. They are color-coded by what depth they started at, since how drifters move to other depths is of interest. Note that the behavior is very different in the winter as compared with the summer.
