Summary: Another successful SciPy conference, along with a talk.


The Scientific Python conference (SciPy) was another success! I co-chaired the Earth, Ocean, and Geoscience mini-symposium with [Scott Collis](https://github.com/scollis) and we had a bunch of great abstracts submitted. This lead to a series of nice talks and posters.

I spoke at the conference this year about the website I've been working on for the Texas General Land Office (TGLO) which combines together operational data and model output along with all available past information.

We have recently modernized the website to include more data and operational numerical model output, and to improve ease of use.</p></blockquote>
