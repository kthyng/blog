Summary: Finishing REU 2018 summer program


After 10 busy weeks, we are saying goodbye to the 2018 REU students. The second-to-last day of the program, the students presented posters at the Texas A&M REU poster symposium.

The last day of the program, the students each gave a 10-12 minute presentation on their summer research, and we celebrated their hard work in the evening.
