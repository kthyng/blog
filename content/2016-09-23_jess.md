Summary: Paper out with Jess Fitzsimmons!


A new study is out with [Dr. Jess Fitzsimmons](https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/faculty/fitzsimmonsjessica.html), a colleague in my department. The [paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GB005357/full) is about trace metals in the Southeastern Pacific Ocean. I am not a chemist, but I had a chance to contribute to this article by performing Optimum Multiparameter Analysis â€” a method used to approximate the fraction of each relevant water mass at a data location given properties of the water mass end members. The analysis is shown below.
