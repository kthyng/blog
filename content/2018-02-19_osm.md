Summary: Traveled to Portland, OR, for Ocean Sciences where I gave a talk and met up with former student


The Ocean Sciences Meeting was in Portland, OR, this year. I have a talk on along-coast connectivity, and I had a small reunion with my summer 2017 REU student Cassidy Gonzalez-Morabito (and REU program PI Lisa Campbell, TAMU, below), who was an [ASLOMP Fellow](https://aslo.org/page/aslomp) and presented a poster on her summer research.
