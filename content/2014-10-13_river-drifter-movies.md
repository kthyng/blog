Summary: Animations of drifters input at the major rivers on the Texas-Louisiana shelf


I have run simulations of surface drifters with the drifters being input with the fresh water of the Atchafalaya and Mississippi rivers, and have posted [movies online](http://kristenthyng.com/txla_river_drifters.html). The circle shows the current location of the drifters, and the tail shows several days of previous positions.
