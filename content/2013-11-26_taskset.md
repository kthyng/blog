Summary: How to use the taskset command

When I am running analysis or plotting scripts on a Linux workstation, I often employ "poor a man's" parallel processing: starting multiple instances of a script with different parameters to decrease the amount of time until I get my results. I have noticed that instead of nicely shifting each new process to a separate core on the workstation, sometimes the processes will get stacked on one core. I figured out how to manually move them around with a lot of googling one day, so I am hoping to save someone the same trouble. Note that this will not work on a Mac.

* Start your processes
* Find the process PIDs with `top` or your favorite method
* Check which node the processes are running on with <br>
`taskset -p [PID]` <br>
for each process PID
* If the node number is the same for multiple processes, you will want to change the node being used to spread them out. If your Linux machine has 12 nodes, choose a different number between 0 and 11 from the other process. Change the process node with<br>
`taskset -p [CORE NUMBER] [PID]`
* Another check to `top` should show that the processes are now each allowed to use 100% of the CPU per node instead of sharing.
