Summary: Paper on colormaps now published


My new paper is now [published](http://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/29-3_thyng.pdf) on colormaps in oceanography! I wrote it with Chad Greene at UT, and Rob Hetland, Heather Zimmerle, and Steve DiMarco at Texas A&M in my department. In it, we discuss guidelines for choosing good colormaps to properly show your data, and present a suite of colormaps to help you do so.
