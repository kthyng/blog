Summary: cmocean - colormaps for oceanography


Several iterations of colormaps have rotated through this blog. These have changed over time with input from colleagues and additional tools and expertise. The colormaps package has been renamed `cmocean` and is [available](https://github.com/matplotlib/cmocean) through matplotlib's github page. Documentation is [available as well](http://matplotlib.org/cmocean/).
