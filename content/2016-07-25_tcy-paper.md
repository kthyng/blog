Summary: Paper on TCY oil spill now published


A paper that I contributed to is now [available](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16303964)! I modeled the Texas City "Y" oil spill, which occurred in Galveston Bay – near the Texas City "Y" – in March 2014, as part of an effort with researchers at UTMSI to better understand the spill. It was a great interdisciplinary effort!
